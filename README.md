# DataSciencePortfolio
I will be posting all my Data Science related projects here.

My name is Tassio Canhadas
Aspiring Data Scientist | MBA in Data Science (Graduating August 2026)

I am passionate about applying machine learning, predictive modeling, and data visualization to solve real-world problems.
With experience in Python, SQL, Tableau, and machine learning algorithms, I enjoy building end-to-end solutions that transform raw data into actionable insights.

Iâ€™m currently seeking Data Science internships where I can contribute to model development, analytics, and data-driven decision-making while continuing to grow my skills in AI, predictive analytics, and business strategy.
